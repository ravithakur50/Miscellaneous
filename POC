RAG Dev Environment with AWS Bedrock – Task Breakdown


Phase 1: POC Setup Planning
	1. Define POC Objectives
	• Clarify business and technical outcomes (e.g., accurate document Q&A, velocity of retrieval).
	• Outcome: Documented POC success criteria and measurable benchmarks.
	2. Stakeholder Identification
	• Pinpoint core users, sponsors, and technical contacts.
	• Outcome: Stakeholder map and pilot user group defined.
	3. Requirements Collection
	• Collect initial functional and non-functional requirements (data sources, security, latency needs).
	• Outcome: Consolidated requirements document.

Phase 2: Cloud Environment Preparation
1. AWS Account Setup
• Confirm or create isolated AWS account/project for the POC (ideally development or sandbox).
• Outcome: Dedicated, compliant AWS environment.
2. Bedrock Model Activation
• Request/enable access to selected Bedrock models (e.g., Claude, Titan embeddings).
• Outcome: Service availability confirmed by AWS console or automated test.
3. Network & Security Preparation
• Set up VPC, IAM roles, audit logging, and apply least-privilege access controls for the project.
• Outcome: Clean environment with base security posture.

Phase 3: Data Preparation & Ingestion
1. Source Data Selection
• Choose initial knowledge base: Confluence export, internal FAQs, policy docs, or sample corpus.
• Outcome: Sample/document corpus ready for ingestion.
2. Data Extraction & Cleansing
• Build scripts/functions to fetch, clean, and normalize text content.
• Outcome: Structured data files (CSV, JSON) in S3, free of noise and duplicates.
3. Metadata Enrichment
• Add useful tags (source, creation date, owner, topic) to each document or chunk.
• Outcome: Enriched dataset supporting better retrieval.

Phase 4: Embedding & Vector Store Setup
1. Embedding Generation
• Use Titan embeddings (Bedrock API) to convert text chunks to vector representations.
• Outcome: Embeddings stored; indexed with identifiers.
2. Vector Database Deployment
• Deploy and configure a vector store (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch, or Pinecone for approved pilots).
• Outcome: Vector DB operational, accessible via API.
3. Ingestion & Index Testing
• Validate retrieval via test queries (ensure top-k document accuracy).
• Outcome: Queries return expected relevant results.


Phase 6: User Interface & Pilot Testing
1. Simple Frontend Prototype
• Build UI (web app or Teams plugin) that connects to backend pipeline.
• Outcome: Usable interface for pilot users.
2. Feedback & Evaluation Mechanism
• Implement feedback form; log user rating and qualitative comments with each query result.
• Outcome: Feedback data captured for tuning and reporting.
3. Sample User Testing
• Onboard 10–20 internal pilot users to interact and submit evaluation data.
• Outcome: Performance report (accuracy, latency, relevance) vs POC KPIs.

Phase 7: Review, Iteration, and POC Closure
1. Analyze Results
• Review performance data, user feedback, error logs, and hallucination rates.
• Outcome: Summary analysis and recommendations.
2. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
• Write process documentation: architecture, key learnings, next phase recommendations.
• Outcome: Final POC package for stakeholder review.
3. POC Debrief
• Host closure meeting; collect signoff, plan for next steps if successful.
Outcome: Decision on further scale, model tuning, or integration.
